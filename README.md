# SkillBridge

Smart Career & Placement Intelligence Platform (AI-Enabled)

## Project Overview
SkillBridge is an AI-enabled, rule-based intelligent system
designed to analyze student performance, skills, and
practice consistency to determine placement readiness
and provide suitable career recommendations.

## Problem Statement
Many students prepare for placements without knowing
their actual readiness level. Academic marks alone are
not enough to judge employability, while practical skills
and consistency are often ignored.

## Solution
This system uses rule-based artificial intelligence and
decision-tree logic to provide transparent and explainable
placement readiness analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- HTML, CSS
- SQLite / MySQL
- Rule-Based Artificial Intelligence
- Git & GitHub
